		 <p>The Fonbureau has put up a nice little micro-site (ugh that term still makes me cringe from my time spent in advertising) for their latest font Neue Haas Grotesk. It’s a genuinely well made typeface that will definitely prove useful. I am picking up a copy myself.</p>
		<p> There is some hauteness happening in the portfolio of German motion/animation studio Sehsucht. I think I posted some of their work a while back but their has been some updates including the above Pictoplasma Festival 2012 opener, which is amazing by the way.</p>
